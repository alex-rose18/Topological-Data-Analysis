# Topological-Data-Analysis
You are an engineer on a ship searching for oil. The ship has produced a topological (sea depth) map of an area of interest. Your company now wants to drill a test well, however, there are many underwater mountains around the site of interest. It is your job to examine the topological data being produced by the ship and find a suitable flat region on the sea bed in which to drill.

Extracting the data and plotting it as a mesh with correct depth correction for accuracy of drilling limits.

Using the mesh and data pointer function on the figure tool within MATLAB, we are able to determine the limits of the flattest region on the mesh and plot that region to determine the maximum deviation in elevation of the seabed.
